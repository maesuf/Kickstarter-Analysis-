# Kickstarting with Excel 

## Overview of Project

### Analyze how kickstarter campaigns performed based on their fundraising goals. Analyze how the campaigns did over time from launch

## Analysis and Challenges

### The sucessful campaigns started off stronger than the failed campaigns but both started to decline over time. The biggest spike for the sucessful campaigns took place from March To May. After May there was a significant decline and this can been seen from the chart titled Theater Outcomes Based on Lauch Date.<img width="1074" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-08 at 10 58 21 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97330455/148672767-ee7763bf-99e4-4e26-af69-433e924dd426.png">

### Goals that had less than 1000, 1000 to 4999, 35000 to 39999 and 40000 to 44999 did better since they all were in or above the 75th percentaline (67% sucess or higher). Goals that had 25000 to 29999, 45000 and greater were the toughest to meet since they all scored in the 25th percentalie (22% success or lower). <img width="205" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-08 at 11 17 17 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97330455/148673047-0a3a89b1-cb67-47a1-9108-77b5e22769a0.png"> both percentiles were calculated using the quartile equation to calculate the first and third quartile 

### The challenge i encountered was making sure the range based on the goals were accurately entered and counted for in the counifs statement. I had to make sure that i was using the greater and greater than or equal to appropartely

## Results

### The biggest spike for the sucessful campaigns took place from March To May. After May there was a significant decline. There was also an overall decline over the course of the year

### Goals that had 45000 or higher failed which lead me to beleive that number could very diffifult to attian and meet. Goals that had 1000 of less were easier to meet

March, April and May were better months to launch but it would be nice to see why. Certain fundraising number were easier to attain than others and it would nice to see why there is a correlation between specific ranges. Goals that had less than 1000, 1000 to 4999, 35000 to 39999 and 40000 to 44999 all scored in the 75th percentile. Were those plays better and what influcended the sucess for those goals? These are some of the limiations to the dataset

A box whisker chart would be great for theater outcomes based on lauch becuase that can show us the best months and the worst months for lauch.
